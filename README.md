# NATO phonetic alphabet converter 
This is a pet project aiming to resolve a real life problem. Often when 
I need to communicate with a user support via phone and tell them a username 
or similar, but they don't understand me well because usually they are not English
native. This is a Python console project which converts inputted text to
[NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet).

Usage: 
```
python main.py
Type a word or username to spell phonetically. Type "quit" to exit.
Enter text:username
Phonetic Spelling: 
u as Uniform
s as Sierra
e as Echo
r as Romeo
n as November
a as Alfa
m as Mike
e as Echo
Enter text:quit
Exiting. Goodbye!
```
